# Decisions

## 2026-07-18 — Rules chat sends an explicit preferred edition

**Area:** Rules chat / Supabase Edge Functions
**Decision:** The browser sends the current `V5` / `V20` / `general` mode as
top-level `preferredEdition` in every `librarian-chat` request and marks the
matching rulebook inventory item as `preferred`. Client-side query parsing and
book planning may recognize an explicit V5/V20 hint in the question, while the
authenticated Librarian enforces the UI mode as its search priority;
`general` leaves its source unrestricted. If Librarian search finds no fragments
in the selected V5/V20 edition, it may retry the other edition, but its answer
must explicitly warn that the following information comes from that edition.
**Reason:** The UI selection must affect both local retrieval planning and the
edition context and tool search used by the authenticated Librarian.
**Consequences:** The Edge Function allow-lists the incoming mode and defaults
invalid or missing legacy values to V5. Cross-edition results are marked with
`used_other_edition`, `preferred_edition` and `searched_edition` so the model is
required to emit the fallback warning and cannot present that mechanic as a
rule of the selected edition. The Edge Function also remembers every successful
cross-edition fallback for the request and deterministically prefixes a clear
warning if the final model answer omitted one. The `book_pages` RPC, JWT
validation, RLS and authentication flow are unchanged. This conservative
tracking may produce an extra warning if the model later mixes sources; that
false positive is preferred to missing the required fallback disclosure.

## 2026-07-13 — Player transcripts use an owner-only resumable AI pipeline

**Area:** Chronicle library / Supabase persistence / external LLM
**Decision:** A library member may upload a complete TXT/Markdown/SRT/VTT
transcript as a private player source. The browser normalizes subtitle noise,
splits without truncation, persists every raw chunk, and invokes the
`personal-chronicle-processor` Edge Function for one bounded DeepSeek operation
at a time. Completion atomically creates two owner-only documents: the full
speaker-labelled clean transcript and a shorter player-perspective chronicle.
The active library chronicle is a grouping key only; membership does not grant
other members access to personal documents.
**Reason:** Large automatic transcripts cannot safely fit in one Edge/LLM
request, and players need visible progress, restart safety, full source
preservation and a concise game record without exposing private notes to the
rest of the group.
**Consequences:** `personal_chronicle_jobs`,
`personal_chronicle_job_chunks`, `personal_chronicle_documents` and
`personal_chronicle_document_chunks` are protected by owner RLS and have no
anon grants. Raw and processed chunks persist after completion. The browser may
resume any unfinished job; final document creation uses the security-invoker
`complete_personal_chronicle_job(...)` RPC. `librarian-chat` searches official
and personal history through separate fixed RPCs with the caller's JWT; it has
no SQL tool or service-role bypass. Migrations `personal_chronicle_pipeline`
and `personal_chronicle_fk_indexes`, plus Edge Function
`personal-chronicle-processor` v1, were applied to production.
**Affected files:** `modules/chronicle-library/*`,

## 2026-07-13 — Private Chronicle reader and upload use the library membership boundary

**Area:** Library UI / Supabase persistence / private game history
**Decision:** `/library/chronicles` is a Reference-style reader over the private
`library_chronicle_chunks` corpus. Authenticated users see every library
chronicle they have joined and may join another by its exact active title.
Storytellers may upload Markdown/TXT only to a target already present in their
library membership list. The browser cleans and sections the text; the
`SECURITY INVOKER` `replace_library_chronicle_document(...)` RPC validates the
payload and atomically replaces one `source_name` under RLS.
**Reason:** Chronicle history needs the same readable/searchable experience as
the public rules reference, but its access boundary is per game. Uploading must
make new text available to all game members and to DeepSeek without exposing a
general write or query tool.
**Consequences:** Direct chunk writes and the RPC require both an authoritative
`chronicle_members` Storyteller role and the caller's own
`library_chronicle_members` row for the target. Players remain read-only. A
same-name upload replaces one document in a transaction; a failed upload leaves
the earlier version intact. Raw chronicle files remain outside Git.
**Affected files:** `app/library/chronicles/page.tsx`,
`modules/chronicle-library/*`, `supabase/library_chronicles.sql`,
`modules/home/components/MainScreen.tsx`, `scripts/test-chronicle-library.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-13 — Library chronicles use separate opt-in membership

**Area:** Rules chat / Supabase persistence / private game history
**Decision:** Private game transcripts in the Library use
`library_chronicles`, `library_chronicle_members` and
`library_chronicle_chunks`, not the master-console `chronicles` /
`chronicle_members` contract. Entering an exact active title through
`open_library_chronicle(title)` creates or refreshes only the caller's library
membership; `list_my_library_chronicles()` returns the most recently opened
membership first. The first library chronicle is `Знамение Геенны 1`, populated
from six local Markdown records as 87 cleaned, section-addressed chunks. Private
chronicle text is ingested directly and is not committed to Git.
**Reason:** A player should enter a known game title once and have it selected
on later visits, while library access must never self-grant player/master rights
to the live game room.
**Consequences:** All three tables have RLS. Users can select only chronicles,
memberships and chunks for which `user_id = auth.uid()`. Chunk write grants are
limited by Storyteller-plus-membership RLS policies; ordinary players remain
read-only. The narrowly scoped security-definer `open_library_chronicle`
checks `auth.uid()`, normalizes the exact title, has an empty `search_path`, and
is executable only by `authenticated`. DeepSeek gets the controlled
`search_my_chronicle(queries)` tool only in the context of the canonical active
membership validated with the caller's JWT; its database RPC rechecks
membership. Switching chronicles clears browser chat history to prevent source
mixing.
**Affected files:** `supabase/library_chronicles.sql`,
`modules/rules-chat/components/RulesChatPage.tsx`,
`supabase/functions/librarian-chat/{index,tools}.ts`,

## 2026-07-13 — DeepSeek chooses read-only rules-chat tools

**Area:** Rules chat / Supabase Edge Functions / external LLM
**Decision:** `librarian-chat` is an authenticated tool-calling loop. DeepSeek
may request `find_my_characters(names)`, `search_rulebooks(queries, edition)` or
the membership-scoped `search_my_chronicle(queries)`; the Edge Function
validates arguments and executes only the corresponding fixed RPCs with the
caller's JWT. The model never receives SQL, database credentials or a general
query tool. Character lookup accepts partial names and can return several named
sheets in one call. Journal data remains device-local and is passed explicitly
by the browser.
**Reason:** Browser heuristics skipped character sheets when a player used a
name without «мой/моя», and a two-character relationship question could be
reduced to an unrelated clan summary. The answer model needs to choose which
trusted source to inspect and refine book terminology when the first search is
weak.
**Consequences:** `verify_jwt` remains enabled. Character isolation continues
to be enforced inside the parameterless `get_my_characters()` RPC. Tool rounds
and result sizes are capped; the first model step must select one trusted tool,
while later steps may refine or answer. Images and bulky editor metadata are
omitted from character tool output. Book hits used by the model are returned to
the browser for visible page citations. The default model is
`deepseek-v4-flash`, with `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` as an operator override; non-thinking mode keeps the
multi-round tool protocol deterministic and avoids reasoning-content replay.
**Affected files:** `supabase/functions/librarian-chat/{index,tools}.ts`,

`modules/rules-chat/components/RulesChatPage.tsx`,

## 2026-07-13 — Rules chat retrieval is context-aware; DeepSeek is answer-only

**Area:** Rules chat / Supabase / external LLM
**Decision:** The browser builds several short rule-language queries from the
current question (and, for a follow-up, the previous user question), searches
them through the existing authenticated `search_book_pages` RPC, and combines
duplicate pages with reciprocal-rank fusion. Conversational forms and common
RU inflections/typos around Hunger, Blood, feeding and awakening are normalized
before search. DeepSeek receives only the fused excerpts and does not decide
what exists in the database. The available V5/V20 titles are passed separately
as inventory metadata. Empty retrieval must be described as "no exact answer in
the found fragments", never as proof that the rule is absent from the books.
**Reason:** A single `websearch_to_tsquery` over a whole conversational sentence
required every meaningful word to occur on one page. It also lost the subject
of follow-up turns and let previous assistant wording outweigh current source
text.
**Consequences:** The `book_pages` schema and RPC contract stay unchanged. Core
rules questions may issue several small RPCs in parallel. Book excerpts outrank
site/reference text in the answer prompt; V5 and V20 mechanics remain separate.
**Affected files:** `modules/rules-chat/engine.ts`,
`modules/rules-chat/components/RulesChatPage.tsx`,
`supabase/functions/librarian-chat/index.ts`, `scripts/test-rules-chat-search.ts`
**Status:** superseded by “DeepSeek chooses read-only rules-chat tools” above

## 2026-07-13 — Rules chat personal data: owner-only via `get_my_characters`

**Area:** Supabase persistence / rules chat
**Decision:** The rules chat reads character sheets exclusively through the
parameterless security-definer RPC `get_my_characters()`, which filters by
`users.auth_user_id = auth.uid()` — it cannot return another user's data. The
player journal is read from `vtm-journal:{userId}:*` in localStorage on the
player's own device and never leaves it. Reference search reuses
`modules/reference` corpus + `searchReferenceCorpus`.
**Reason:** Strict per-user isolation requested for chat access to sheets and
journals.
**Consequences:** Known gap: the legacy sheet/table flows still read the
`characters` table with the anon key (client-side user_id filter), so
table-level lockdown is a separate migration that must not break legacy pages.
Do not add parameters to `get_my_characters`.
**Affected files:** `supabase/rules_chat_personal.sql`,
`modules/rules-chat/engine.ts`, `modules/rules-chat/components/RulesChatPage.tsx`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-13 — Rulebook pages in Supabase (`book_pages`) for the rules assistant

**Area:** Supabase persistence / rules reference
**Decision:** Full text of the RU rulebooks (V5 corebook RU — OCR'd, V20 RU —
extracted) lives in `public.book_pages`, one row per PDF page, with a generated
`tsvector` (russian/english config by `lang`) and `search_book_pages(query,
source, limit)` RPC returning ranked `ts_headline` snippets with page numbers.
The exact owned PDFs were re-extracted on 2026-07-13: V5 with page-image OCR
and layout-aware column ordering, V20 from its text layer with coordinate-aware
column ordering. The ingest UI normalizes soft hyphens, wrapped words and line
wraps; the RPC returns one coherent fragment instead of disconnected excerpts.
Page numbers are PDF pages of the exact files the group owns, so citations can
be checked against the real book. Book text is NOT committed to the repo
(copyright); it is ingested by a master via `/master/ingest-books` from locally
generated JSONL files. RLS: read — authenticated only; write — masters only
(`is_any_chronicle_master`). The site must show only short snippets publicly.
**Reason:** Foundation for grounded VTM rules answers: Postgres FTS answers
"where in the book" queries before any answer model receives context.
**Consequences:** Re-ingest by re-uploading JSONL (upsert on source+page). New
books = new `source` slug. The pre-cleanup rows are retained for rollback in
`private.book_pages_backup_20260713` with no app-role grants. Do not add anon
read policies.
**Affected files:** `supabase/book_pages.sql`, `app/master/ingest-books/page.tsx`,

## 2026-07-12 — Legacy login migrated to Supabase Auth (synthetic emails)

**Area:** Auth / Supabase persistence
**Decision:** Site login now creates a real Supabase Auth session. Auth email is
synthetic and deterministic: first 32 hex chars of `sha256(username)` +
`@vtm.local`, computed identically in the client (`archiveEmail` in
`modules/home/components/MainScreen.tsx`) and SQL
(`public.archive_email_for_username`). Registration goes through the
security-definer RPC `register_archive_user` (not GoTrue signup), so email
confirmation settings are irrelevant. `public.users` remains the profile table;
`users.auth_user_id` links it to `auth.users`. All 15 legacy users were migrated
in place with their original passwords (legacy `password_hash` was base64 of the
plaintext). `migrate_legacy_auth` RPC self-heals any stragglers at login.
Chronicle `campaign-666` provisioned with user Anna as master.
**Reason:** Master console tables are RLS-locked to `authenticated` +
`chronicle_members`; the old localStorage/`public.users` login had no
`auth.uid()`, so nothing on `/master` could persist.
**Consequences:** Users keep the same username+password UX; characters/chat keep
referencing `public.users.id`. Already-logged-in browsers must log in once more
to obtain an auth session. New master memberships are still provisioned by
admin SQL — no client self-claim. Do not reintroduce direct inserts into
`public.users` from the client.
**Affected files:** `modules/home/components/MainScreen.tsx`,
`supabase/legacy_users_to_supabase_auth.sql`, `lib/supabase.ts` (unchanged keys)
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-11 — Master multi-window and session log

- **Detached display**: `?display=detached` uses the same `/master` route with a
  minimal shell (no sidebar chrome). Opened via `window.open`; popup-blocked is
  a first-class error message. Closing a detached window does not remove the
  module from the primary shell.
- **Sync stack**: Supabase Realtime for domain tables; `BroadcastChannel` +
  `localStorage` events for *small* cross-window signals only (navigate/layout
  hints, hello/bye). Never full state snapshots on the bus.
- **Layouts**: `master_layouts.layout_json` stores module composition
  (`schemaVersion`, `activeModuleId`, …) — **not** window geometry. Optimistic
  concurrency via `layout_version`; conflicts offer keep / take / save-copy.
- **Session log vs player journal**: separate tables and keys
  (`session_log_*` / `vtm-session-log:*` vs `vtm-journal:*`). Publish copies body
  into `session_log_published`; players never SELECT drafts.
- **Search**: module-owned providers on contributions; shell only fans out.
  Role-scoped fetches (no "download private then hide on client").

## 2026-07-11 — Blood bonds use VTM5 adapter + append-only events

**Area:** Master console / blood bonds / VTM rules
**Decision:** Bond level, drink progression, warnings and resist difficulties
live in pure `core/systems/vtm5/rules/blood-bonds` and
`createVtm5BloodBondAdapter()`. Direction is thrall→regnant. Active pair is
unique; self-bond forbidden. UI is graph (SVG layout utility) + keyboard list +
detail. Break/deactivate sets status and inserts `blood_bond_events` — no
DELETE of history. Tables are master RLS only (private by default).
**Reason:** Mechanics stay testable and RU UI does not hardcode V5 text paths;
audit requires immutable events.
**Consequences:** Deploy `supabase/blood_bonds.sql`. Clients have no DELETE on
`blood_bond_events`. LocalStorage fallback when Auth/SQL undeployed.
**Affected files:** `core/systems/vtm5/rules/blood-bonds/*`,
`core/systems/vtm5/adapters/blood-bonds.ts`, `modules/blood-bonds/*`,
`supabase/blood_bonds.sql`

## 2026-07-11 — Chronicle lore is separate from system reference

**Area:** Master console / lore
**Decision:** `modules/lore` stores only chronicle-authored content in
`chronicle_lore_categories`, `chronicle_lore_entries`,
`chronicle_lore_entry_private`, and `chronicle_random_tables`. System VTM rules
are surfaced via `modules/reference` adapter hits and never copied from
`public/rules.json` into Supabase. Entity relations use
`chronicle_entity_links`. Private GM notes are physically separate and omitted
from shared select policies / public mappers. Random tables support weighted
rows; rolls append `lore.random_table.roll` to `master_action_log`.
**Reason:** Avoid rules-data drift and secret leakage while allowing campaign
compendium + cross-module chips.
**Consequences:** Deploy `supabase/chronicle_lore.sql`. Player-facing search
must call `searchLoreCompendium({ includeMasterOnly: false })`.
**Affected files:** `modules/lore/*`, `supabase/chronicle_lore.sql`,
`modules/master-console/contributions.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-11 — Master scenes shell reuses table scene engine

**Area:** Master console / scenes / layers
**Decision:** `modules/master-scenes` is a master UI shell over
`table_scenes` / `table_images` / `table_scene_music` APIs. Preview selects a
scene without activating it; **Publish** sets `is_active`, deactivates others,
broadcasts one `scene-active` event (`fade: true`) on the existing `table-room`
channel, and logs `scenes.publish`. Light presets are pure data applied to
master preview only until publish. Interactives live in master-only
`master_scene_objects` with a public projection table that omits
`private_config`. Player canvas filters out `owner_role=master` layers.
Music uses `table_music` / global engine only.
**Reason:** One scene engine for table and master; no GameTable fork.
**Consequences:** Deploy `supabase/master_scenes.sql` for meta/interactives.
Reorder of scene list is meta-local until sort_order is provisioned.
**Affected files:** `modules/master-scenes/*`, `supabase/master_scenes.sql`,
`modules/table/GameTable.tsx` (GM layer filter), `useTableRealtime.ts` (fade)
**Status:** active

---

## 2026-07-11 — Night overview aggregates; does not copy domain data

**Area:** Master console / overview
**Decision:** `modules/master-overview` is a read-model + light master-only
writes module. Coterie/NPC cards are selectors over `modules/actors` + active
`table_scenes`; timeline merges `master_action_log` and public `table_rolls`;
macros call actors hunger APIs and `master-rolls` services. Session notes and
plot hooks use `master_session_notes` / `master_plot_hooks` (master RLS) with
localStorage fallback when Auth/SQL are undeployed. No demo seed data.
**Reason:** Command center must stay current with source entities and must not
fork character/scene/roll storage.
**Consequences:** Cards deep-link to actors module or full sheet; lore deep-link
is a stub until the lore module exists. Deploy `supabase/master_overview.sql`.
**Affected files:** `modules/master-overview/*`, `supabase/master_overview.sql`,
`modules/master-console/contributions.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-11 — Master roller reuses RollMessage; hidden rolls are not table_rolls

**Area:** Master console / rolls / privacy
**Decision:** The permanent `/master` right rail mounts `modules/master-rolls`
and does not unmount on central module change. Public rolls use the same
`RollMessage` + `insertRollRecord` / `table_rolls` path as `/table`. Hidden rolls
never broadcast and never insert into `table_rolls` until explicit reveal; they
persist in `master_hidden_rolls` (master RLS only) or a master-local fallback if
Auth/schema is undeployed. Actor pools/hunger come from `modules/actors`
(`actorToRollCharacter` + `normalizeActor`). Undo uses typed inverse operations
on a session stack (Ctrl/Cmd+Z skips focused editors), not state snapshots.
**Reason:** One roll format for table compatibility; physical separation so
players cannot SELECT or realtime-subscribe to hidden results.
**Consequences:** Deploy `supabase/master_hidden_rolls.sql` with master
membership. Contested rolls against chronicle actors resolve both sides on the
master client; live player opposed proposals remain table-owned.
**Affected files:** `modules/master-rolls/*`, `supabase/master_hidden_rolls.sql`,
`modules/master-console/components/MasterRightRail.tsx`, `core/hub/{types,presets}.ts`
**Status:** active (SQL/Auth pending for durable hidden storage)

## 2026-07-11 — Master NPC module is a contribution over the actors domain

**Area:** Master console / actors UI
**Decision:** The «НПС и SPC» screen is `modules/actors` UI registered as a
static `MasterConsoleContribution` in `modules/master-console/contributions.ts`.
`MasterConsoleContribution` / `MasterModuleProps` live in
`modules/master-console/types.ts` (not `core/hub`). The module reuses actor
API/hooks/services, table character-sheet URLs, scene id for “in scene”, and
master action log append; it never imports `GameTable.tsx`. Quick roll/Rouse
emit a typed `MasterRollRequest` into the right rail until `master-rolls` owns
the full roller. Create templates are data in `utils/actor-templates.ts`.
Linked-sheet hunger edits use `manual_overrides.stats` so master clients do not
rewrite player-owned `characters.data`.
**Reason:** Keep one actor domain, one console shell, and a reviewable UI PR
without a second table orchestrator or JSX-per-template branches.
**Consequences:** Other master features register the same contribution contract.
Full roller, multi-window layouts, and Auth-backed create/load still depend on
later phases and SQL deploy.
**Affected files:** `modules/actors/{components,utils,contribution,services}/*`,
`modules/master-console/{types,contributions,components,MasterConsoleShell}.*`
**Status:** active (SQL/Auth still pending for live persistence)

## 2026-07-11 — Actors reference character sheets instead of copying them

**Area:** Actors / character persistence / VTM adapters
**Decision:** `chronicle_actors` is the unified identity for PC, full NPC and
compact SPC records. A linked actor stores only `character_id`; every hydration
loads the canonical `characters` row. Compact actors store a small stat block.
GM-only fields live in `chronicle_actor_private`, and normalized/public actor
payloads cannot contain that object. VTM vitals and simple pools are computed in
`core/systems/vtm5/adapters/actors.ts`.
**Reason:** Copying `characters.data` would create drift and could leak secrets.
A separate compact representation is still needed for SPCs without full sheets.
**Consequences:** A partial unique index prevents duplicate character links per
chronicle. Unlink never deletes a character. Compact-to-full conversion creates
a sheet through the canonical ownership flow and links its returned ID. Bulk
updates use one room-scoped, whitelisted RPC.
**Affected files:** `supabase/chronicle_actors.sql`, `modules/actors/*`,
`modules/table/api/character-api.ts`, `core/systems/vtm5/adapters/actors.ts`
**Status:** pending SQL deploy and Auth provisioning

---

## 2026-07-11 — Master persistence requires Auth membership and has no room self-claim

**Area:** Master console / Supabase / security
**Decision:** Master persistence is scoped by `chronicles.id` and protected by
`chronicle_members(user_id, chronicle_id, role)` using `auth.uid()`. All master
tables revoke anon privileges. A first master cannot claim a room from the
browser; the initial chronicle and membership are provisioned by service role or
an administrator. `room` remains an indexed compatibility slug and is checked
against `chronicle_id` by triggers.
**Reason:** The existing localStorage identity and master password cannot enforce
RLS. Client self-claim would let the first authenticated user take over an
existing legacy room.
**Consequences:** The current `/master` shell remains persistence-disabled until
the login flow supplies a Supabase Auth session and an administrator provisions
membership. Master Realtime uses separate room-filtered postgres subscriptions;
players cannot select the rows under RLS. `master_action_log` exposes only
SELECT/INSERT and is append-only to clients.
**Affected files:** `supabase/master_console_persistence.sql`,
`modules/master-console/{persistence,api,hooks}/*`
**Status:** pending SQL deploy and Auth provisioning

---

## 2026-07-11 — Master console is a separate Hub module, not a second GameTable

**Area:** Master console / routing / Hub
**Decision:** `/master?room=...` mounts `modules/master-console` as a VTM5 Hub
module. It bootstraps the same chronicle runtime and canonical room resolver as
the table, composes its own desktop shell, and does not import `GameTable`.
The current local master-password contract is shared through
`modules/table/utils/room-session.ts` and is always required regardless of URL role.
**Reason:** Establish a reviewable shell and module boundary without duplicating
table orchestration, persistence, scenes, rolls or music.
**Consequences:** Business contributions and Supabase data are deferred. The
compatibility gate blocks URL-only access but does not provide real privacy;
Auth/RLS remains a prerequisite for master secrets.
**Affected files:** `app/master/page.tsx`, `modules/master-console/*`,
`core/hub/{types,presets}.ts`, `modules/table/hooks/useRoomSession.ts`,
`modules/table/utils/room-session.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-11 — Shared VTM UI tokens have one canonical owner

**Area:** UI architecture / game table / master console
**Decision:** Shared VTM colors, typography, spacing, radii, control heights,
shadows, glow, grid, focus, scrollbar and reduced-motion rules live in
`modules/ui/vtm-theme/*`. Feature roots opt into scoped behavior with
`VTM_THEME_CLASS`; feature-specific selectors remain in their feature module.
**Reason:** The future master console must reuse the table design system without
copying the large `GameTableStyles.tsx` block or introducing a second token set.
**Consequences:** Add or change shared VTM variables only in `tokens.css`. Do not
move table layout/component selectors into the shared theme.
**Affected files:** `modules/ui/vtm-theme/*`, `app/globals.css`,
`modules/table/GameTable.tsx`, `modules/table/components/GameTableStyles.tsx`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-08 — Deprecated module compatibility shims removed

**Area:** Architecture / module migration
**Decision:** Deprecated re-export shims under `components/*` and `lib/table/*`
were removed after their runtime code moved into `modules/*`. Imports should use
canonical module paths directly, such as `@/modules/table`,
`@/modules/home`, `@/modules/journal`, `@/modules/reference`, and
`@/modules/character-sheet`.
**Reason:** The app routes now follow the thin `app/*/page.tsx` →
`modules/*Route` pattern, and repo-wide imports no longer need the old
compatibility layer.
**Consequences:** Do not add new imports from deleted `components/*` shims or
`@/lib/table/*`. Use `modules/table/constants.ts`, `modules/table/mappers.ts`,
and `modules/table/utils/*` directly.
**Affected files:** `components/*`, `lib/table/*`, `modules/*`,
`docs/ai/FILE-MAP.md`, `docs/ai/CURRENT-STATE.md`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-07 — Character autosave patches `data` through RPC

**Area:** Supabase persistence / legacy character sheet
**Decision:** Legacy `autoSaveCharacterPatch` now attempts
`rpc('vtm_patch_character_data', { p_id, p_user_id, p_patch })` before falling
back to the old read-merge-write path. The RPC is defined in
`supabase/patch_character_data.sql` and uses `vtm_jsonb_deep_merge`: nested
objects merge recursively, while arrays, scalars, and JSON `null` replace the
previous value. The RPC filters by both `characters.id` and `characters.user_id`
and returns the updated `data` JSON.
**Reason:** Autosave was downloading and uploading the whole character `data`
blob on each small change, which wasted bandwidth and let concurrent tabs
overwrite unrelated keys.
**Consequences:** Deploy `supabase/patch_character_data.sql` to enable the light
atomic path. Until then, the browser logs a warning and uses the old
select+merge+update fallback. Full `saveCharacter` and `updateCurrentCharacterData`
still use their existing full-data paths.
**Affected files:** `public/supabase.js`, `supabase/patch_character_data.sql`
**Status:** pending SQL deploy

## 2026-07-07 — Performance pass: light list selects + static caching

**Area:** Supabase persistence / static assets
**Decision:** (1) Character *lists* select only `id, name, clan,
image:data->>characterImage` (PostgREST JSON-field select) — full `data` is
fetched only when a sheet is actually opened. Applied in `MainScreen.tsx` and
legacy `fetchMyCharacters` (`public/supabase.js`). (2) Heavy legacy statics
(`rules*.json`, `main.js`, etc.) get `Cache-Control: max-age=300,
stale-while-revalidate=604800` via `vercel.json` headers. (3) Storage portraits
are uploaded/served with `max-age=31536000` (migrated objects' metadata updated
in-place). (4) `preconnect` to Supabase in `app/layout.tsx` + `old-sheet.html`.
(5) The React table no longer statically imports `public/rules.json`; mappers and
table damage fallback use generated `modules/table/rules-subset.ts`, built from the
passive tracker/damage mechanics in `public/rules.json`.
**Reason:** List queries pulled ~273 KB where 3 KB suffices; rules.json (1.8 MB)
was bundled into Next client chunks; portraits re-validated/re-downloaded on
every visit.
**Consequences:** New list-consuming code must not expect full `data` from list
queries. Legacy statics may be up to 5 min stale after a deploy (SWR refreshes in
background). If passive discipline mechanics that affect tracker max or damage
fallback change, rerun `node --import tsx scripts/generate-table-rules-subset.ts`.
**Affected files:** `modules/home/components/MainScreen.tsx`, `public/supabase.js`,
`vercel.json`, `app/layout.tsx`, `public/old-sheet.html`,

## 2026-07-07 — Voice chat uses Cloudflare TURN (server-issued credentials)

**Area:** Game table / voice (WebRTC)
**Decision:** `app/api/turn-credentials/route.ts` issues short-lived Cloudflare TURN
credentials (key `vtm-voice-turn`, env `CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_ID` +
`CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN` on Vercel, server-side only). `useTableVoice`
fetches them on voice start (`ensureVoiceIceServers`, 12h cache) and merges with
the default STUN list; without env vars it degrades to STUN-only as before.
Also fixed: ICE candidates arriving before `setRemoteDescription` are now queued
(`pendingIceCandidatesRef`) and flushed, instead of being silently dropped.
**Reason:** P2P voice failed between real players (VPN, RF CGNAT) while
self-testing worked; STUN alone cannot traverse symmetric NAT. Cloudflare TURN
includes `turns:...:443?transport=tcp`, which passes almost any network.
**Consequences:** The TURN secret must never reach the client (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_`).
Rotating the key = create new TURN key in Cloudflare (Realtime → TURN) + update
both Vercel env vars.
**Affected files:** `app/api/turn-credentials/route.ts`,
`modules/table/hooks/useTableVoice.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-07 — Character images live in Storage, not in JSON

**Area:** Supabase persistence / legacy character sheet / chat
**Decision:** Portraits and touchstone images are uploaded to the public Storage
bucket `character-portraits` (`public/supabase.js: uploadPortraitDataUrl`);
`characters.data` and `table_chat_messages.character_image` store only the public
URL. Base64 data-URLs remain a fallback when the upload fails, and old base64
values still render (any `<img src>` accepts both).
**Reason:** Base64 images were embedded up to 4× per sheet (`characterImage`,
`touchstones[].image`, `sheetLock.snapshot`, `sheetLock.baseState`), bloating rows
to 300–840 KB; chat rows carried ~110 KB each. Loading the character list pulled
~7 MB, chat history ~4 MB — the "Supabase is slow" symptom. After migration: avg
character row 13 KB, chat history ~9 KB.
**Consequences:** All existing rows were migrated on 2026-07-07 (backups:
`characters_backup_20260707`, `table_chat_messages_backup_20260707` — drop after
verification). New image code paths must upload to Storage and store URLs, never
embed base64. Bucket + policies: `supabase/character_portraits_storage.sql`.
Replacing an image orphans the old Storage file (acceptable for now).
**Affected files:** `public/supabase.js`, `public/main.js`,
`supabase/character_portraits_storage.sql`

## 2026-07-02 — VTM legacy parity test (`test:vtm-parity`)

**Area:** VTM mechanics / legacy character sheet
**Decision:** `scripts/test-vtm-legacy-parity.ts` (`npm run test:vtm-parity`) is the
guard for `public/vtm-health.js` and `public/vtm-humanity.js` staying aligned with
`core/systems/vtm5/rules/{health,humanity}/index.ts`. Run it after edits on either side.
**Reason:** Duplicated mechanics were the top drift risk between the legacy iframe sheet
and the React table; disciplines already had scripts but health/humanity did not.
**Consequences:** Health/humanity changes require parity pass. Discipline parsing in
`main.js` remains manually checked.
**Affected files:** `scripts/test-vtm-legacy-parity.ts`, `public/vtm-health.js`,
`public/vtm-humanity.js`, `core/systems/vtm5/rules/health/index.ts`,
`core/systems/vtm5/rules/humanity/index.ts`, `package.json`

## 2026-07-02 — Table module decomposition (`modules/table`)

**Area:** Game table / module migration
**Decision:** `modules/table/` is the canonical home for table types, constants,
mappers, utils, Supabase APIs, hooks, and extracted UI modals. `GameTable.tsx`
consumes the module via hooks and components; it still owns orchestration for
rolls, health/willpower, voice WebRTC, and canvas/layer drag.
**Reason:** Gradual decomposition of the ~9k-line monolith following
`modules/chat` and `modules/music` patterns.
**Consequences:** New code imports from `@/modules/table`. `lib/table/*` shims
remain for backward compat. Do not grow `GameTable.tsx` — extend the module.
**Affected files:** `modules/table/*`, `components/table/GameTable.tsx`,
`lib/table/*`, `docs/ai/*`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-02 — Table data layer moved into `modules/table` (superseded)

**Area:** Game table / module migration
**Decision:** Canonical table types, constants and Supabase row mappers now live
in `modules/table/{types,constants,mappers}.ts`. `lib/table/{types,constants,mappers}.ts`
are compatibility shims that re-export from the module. API scaffolds
(`modules/table/api/*`), hooks and component extraction plans are documented but
not yet implemented — `GameTable.tsx` still owns Supabase I/O.
**Reason:** Prepare gradual decomposition of the ~9k-line `GameTable.tsx`
monolith following the same pattern as `modules/chat` and `modules/music`.
**Consequences:** New code should import from `@/modules/table`. `@/lib/table/*`
still works via shims. Utils (`scene-utils`, `layer-utils`, `media-utils`) remain
in `lib/table/` until the next phase.
**Affected files:** `modules/table/*`, `lib/table/{types,constants,mappers}.ts`,
`docs/ai/*`
**Status:** superseded → see “Table module decomposition” above

## 2026-07-02 — Text chat runtime moved into `modules/chat`

**Area:** Chat / module migration
**Decision:** Text chat auth, message types, Supabase API helpers, message
history/realtime state and `ChatPanel` UI now live in `modules/chat/*`.
`GameTable.tsx` consumes `useChat` and composes table-specific voice/master
flows around it.
**Reason:** Chat is a self-contained pluggable feature keyed by chronicle/room.
Moving it out of the table monolith reduces `GameTable.tsx` ownership without
changing the `table_chat_messages` Supabase contract.
**Consequences:** Keep `table_chat_messages` column names unchanged unless there
is a documented Supabase migration. Voice chat and master-private messages are
still table-specific and can move later as separate slices.
**Affected files:** `modules/chat/*`, `components/table/GameTable.tsx`,
`lib/table/types.ts`, `lib/table/mappers.ts`, `lib/table/layer-utils.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-02 — Music runtime moved into `modules/music`

**Area:** Music/media / module migration
**Decision:** The shared room music runtime now lives in `modules/music/*`.
`app/layout.tsx` mounts `GlobalMusicEngineMount` from the module, and
`GameTable.tsx` renders `MusicPlayer` from the module for controls and library
management.
**Reason:** Music is a self-contained pluggable feature with playback adapters,
sync, library helpers and a persistent global engine. Moving it out of
`components/music/*` makes the module boundary explicit without changing
Supabase contracts or playback behavior.
**Consequences:** Keep playback/source-specific behavior in `modules/music`
adapters and keep the root engine mount stable so music survives App Router
navigation. Do not rename `table_music`, `table_music_library`, or the
`table-music` bucket without a Supabase migration decision.
**Affected files:** `modules/music/*`, `app/layout.tsx`,
`components/table/GameTable.tsx`, `lib/table/mappers.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-02 — VTM5 runtime rules moved into `core/systems/vtm5/rules`

**Area:** VTM mechanics / core migration
**Decision:** The TypeScript VTM mechanics runtime has moved from `lib/vtm/*` to
`core/systems/vtm5/rules/*`. Project imports should use the new core path.
**Reason:** This makes the VTM5 rules layer the first concrete Game System Core
under the Hub + Game System Cores + Pluggable Modules architecture.
**Consequences:** Keep `core/systems/vtm5/rules/*` pure and framework-independent.
Legacy duplicates (`public/vtm-health.js`, `public/vtm-humanity.js`) still need
alignment checks when behavior changes. `lib/vtm/*` is no longer the runtime
location.
**Affected files:** `core/systems/vtm5/rules/*`, `components/table/GameTable.tsx`,
`lib/table/types.ts`, `lib/table/mappers.ts`, `scripts/test-discipline-engine.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-02 — Target architecture is Hub + Game System Cores + Pluggable Modules

**Area:** Architecture / migration
**Decision:** The project migrates toward a Hub + Game System Cores + Pluggable
Modules architecture. Next.js routes and global providers form the Hub;
framework-independent VTM rules remain the first game-system core; table,
character sheet, music, media, journal and reference become modules with explicit
contracts.
**Reason:** The app already has a load-bearing legacy sheet and a large React
table orchestrator. A modular target keeps refactoring incremental while making
future game-system and feature boundaries explicit.
**Consequences:** Refactors should first extract pure core logic and stable
module contracts, then API/hooks, then UI folders. `GameTable.tsx` and legacy
files must shrink through small verified steps, not rewrites. See
`docs/architecture.md`.
**Affected files:** `docs/architecture.md`, future `core/systems/vtm5/rules/*` /
`core/systems/vtm5/*`, `components/table/*`, `lib/table/*`, future `modules/*`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — Legacy character sheet stays behind the iframe

**Area:** Character sheet / bridge
**Decision:** The full character sheet remains the legacy `public/old-sheet.html`
+ `public/main.js` app, embedded via `<iframe>` from
`components/screens/CharacterSheetScreen.tsx`, until there is a dedicated
migration task.
**Reason:** The legacy sheet is large (~11k + ~5k lines) and load-bearing.
Rewriting it inline with other work would be high-risk and out of scope.
**Consequences:** New sheet work happens in legacy JS following
`workflows/legacy-edit-protocol.md`; the bridge contract (params, localStorage,
`vtm-character-saved` postMessage) must be preserved.
**Affected files:** `components/screens/CharacterSheetScreen.tsx`,
`public/old-sheet.html`, `public/main.js`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — `GameTable.tsx` is an orchestrator, extract new logic outward

**Area:** Game table
**Decision:** `components/table/GameTable.tsx` is treated as an orchestrator. New
sizeable features go into child components (`components/table/*`), hooks, or
`lib/table/*` / `core/systems/vtm5/rules/*` — not inline into `GameTable.tsx`.
**Reason:** The file is already ~9k lines and concentrates room state, Supabase
I/O, rolls, chat, scenes, layers, media, and modals. Growth increases regression
risk.
**Consequences:** Reviewers should reject changes that grow the monolith when
extraction is feasible. See `workflows/react-table-edit-protocol.md`.
**Affected files:** `components/table/GameTable.tsx`, `components/table/*`,
`lib/table/*`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — VTM mechanics live in `core/systems/vtm5/rules/*` as pure modules

**Area:** VTM mechanics
**Decision:** VTM rules logic (health, humanity, damage, derived stats,
disciplines) is progressively moved into `core/systems/vtm5/rules/*` as pure,
framework-independent, testable modules.
**Reason:** Reuse across React and (eventually) the sheet; testability via the
discipline scripts; a single source of truth over time.
**Consequences:** Where a legacy duplicate exists (`public/vtm-health.js`,
`public/vtm-humanity.js`, discipline parsing in `main.js`), changes must note and
where needed sync the duplicate. See `workflows/vtm-mechanics-edit-protocol.md`.
**Affected files:** `core/systems/vtm5/rules/*`, `public/vtm-health.js`, `public/vtm-humanity.js`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — `rules.json` / `rules_eng.json` are a data layer

**Area:** Rules data
**Decision:** `public/rules.json` (RU) and `public/rules_eng.json` (EN) are the
data layer for clans, skills, disciplines, merits, flaws and predator types. No
UI or behavior logic belongs in them.
**Reason:** Separation of data from logic; both the legacy sheet and
`core/systems/vtm5/rules/disciplines/rules-loader/index.ts` consume them.
**Consequences:** RU and EN must stay structurally in sync; identity is by stable
IDs, not display names (see `subsystems/i18n.md`). Discipline edits run
`audit:disciplines`.
**Affected files:** `public/rules.json`, `public/rules_eng.json`,
`core/systems/vtm5/rules/disciplines/rules-loader/index.ts`, `lib/i18n/ruleNames.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — Supabase contract changes must be documented

**Area:** Supabase persistence
**Decision:** Any change to Supabase table names, storage buckets, or the shape
of saved data must be recorded here (with a migration note) before/with the code
change.
**Reason:** The schema is shared by the React table and the legacy sheet;
undocumented drift breaks save/load and room sync across both layers.
**Consequences:** Follow `workflows/supabase-edit-protocol.md`; update
`lib/table/constants.ts`, mappers, and `supabase/*.sql` together.
**Affected files:** `lib/table/constants.ts`, `lib/table/mappers.ts`,
`lib/supabase.ts`, `public/supabase.js`, `supabase/*.sql`
**Status:** active
