# Decisions

Long-term architectural decisions. One entry per real decision (not per bug).
Use `templates/decision-entry-template.md`. Newest at the top. When a decision is
replaced, set the old one to `superseded` and link the new one.

## 2026-07-02 — Target architecture is Hub + Game System Cores + Pluggable Modules

**Area:** Architecture / migration
**Decision:** The project migrates toward a Hub + Game System Cores + Pluggable
Modules architecture. Next.js routes and global providers form the Hub;
framework-independent VTM rules remain the first game-system core; table,
character sheet, music, media, journal and reference become modules with explicit
contracts.
**Reason:** The app already has a load-bearing legacy sheet and a large React
table orchestrator. A modular target keeps refactoring incremental while making
future game-system and feature boundaries explicit.
**Consequences:** Refactors should first extract pure core logic and stable
module contracts, then API/hooks, then UI folders. `GameTable.tsx` and legacy
files must shrink through small verified steps, not rewrites. See
`docs/architecture.md`.
**Affected files:** `docs/architecture.md`, future `lib/vtm/*` / `core/vtm/*`,
`components/table/*`, `lib/table/*`, future `modules/*`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — Legacy character sheet stays behind the iframe

**Area:** Character sheet / bridge
**Decision:** The full character sheet remains the legacy `public/old-sheet.html`
+ `public/main.js` app, embedded via `<iframe>` from
`components/screens/CharacterSheetScreen.tsx`, until there is a dedicated
migration task.
**Reason:** The legacy sheet is large (~11k + ~5k lines) and load-bearing.
Rewriting it inline with other work would be high-risk and out of scope.
**Consequences:** New sheet work happens in legacy JS following
`workflows/legacy-edit-protocol.md`; the bridge contract (params, localStorage,
`vtm-character-saved` postMessage) must be preserved.
**Affected files:** `components/screens/CharacterSheetScreen.tsx`,
`public/old-sheet.html`, `public/main.js`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — `GameTable.tsx` is an orchestrator, extract new logic outward

**Area:** Game table
**Decision:** `components/table/GameTable.tsx` is treated as an orchestrator. New
sizeable features go into child components (`components/table/*`), hooks, or
`lib/table/*` / `lib/vtm/*` — not inline into `GameTable.tsx`.
**Reason:** The file is already ~9k lines and concentrates room state, Supabase
I/O, rolls, chat, scenes, layers, media, and modals. Growth increases regression
risk.
**Consequences:** Reviewers should reject changes that grow the monolith when
extraction is feasible. See `workflows/react-table-edit-protocol.md`.
**Affected files:** `components/table/GameTable.tsx`, `components/table/*`,
`lib/table/*`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — VTM mechanics live in `lib/vtm/*` as pure modules

**Area:** VTM mechanics
**Decision:** VTM rules logic (health, humanity, damage, derived stats,
disciplines) is progressively moved into `lib/vtm/*` as pure,
framework-independent, testable modules.
**Reason:** Reuse across React and (eventually) the sheet; testability via the
discipline scripts; a single source of truth over time.
**Consequences:** Where a legacy duplicate exists (`public/vtm-health.js`,
`public/vtm-humanity.js`, discipline parsing in `main.js`), changes must note and
where needed sync the duplicate. See `workflows/vtm-mechanics-edit-protocol.md`.
**Affected files:** `lib/vtm/*`, `public/vtm-health.js`, `public/vtm-humanity.js`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — `rules.json` / `rules_eng.json` are a data layer

**Area:** Rules data
**Decision:** `public/rules.json` (RU) and `public/rules_eng.json` (EN) are the
data layer for clans, skills, disciplines, merits, flaws and predator types. No
UI or behavior logic belongs in them.
**Reason:** Separation of data from logic; both the legacy sheet and
`lib/vtm/disciplines/rules-loader.ts` consume them.
**Consequences:** RU and EN must stay structurally in sync; identity is by stable
IDs, not display names (see `subsystems/i18n.md`). Discipline edits run
`audit:disciplines`.
**Affected files:** `public/rules.json`, `public/rules_eng.json`,
`lib/vtm/disciplines/rules-loader.ts`, `lib/i18n/ruleNames.ts`
**Status:** active

## 2026-07-01 — Supabase contract changes must be documented

**Area:** Supabase persistence
**Decision:** Any change to Supabase table names, storage buckets, or the shape
of saved data must be recorded here (with a migration note) before/with the code
change.
**Reason:** The schema is shared by the React table and the legacy sheet;
undocumented drift breaks save/load and room sync across both layers.
**Consequences:** Follow `workflows/supabase-edit-protocol.md`; update
`lib/table/constants.ts`, mappers, and `supabase/*.sql` together.
**Affected files:** `lib/table/constants.ts`, `lib/table/mappers.ts`,
`lib/supabase.ts`, `public/supabase.js`, `supabase/*.sql`
**Status:** active
