# Music and Media

## Purpose
Everything visual and audible on the game table: images/videos/files placed on
the canvas and organized into layers within scenes, plus a music system with
local-audio and YouTube sources, synced across the room.

## Main files
- Music UI/logic: `components/music/MusicPanel.tsx`,
  `components/music/MusicSyncEngine.ts`, `components/music/types.ts`,
  `components/music/utils.ts`.
- Music adapters: `components/music/adapters/localAudioAdapter.ts`,
  `components/music/adapters/youtubeAdapter.ts`.
- Table media/layers: `components/table/{TableCanvas,MediaLibrary,LayerManager,
  SceneManager}.tsx`.
- Media/layer/scene helpers: `lib/table/{media-utils,layer-utils,scene-utils}.ts`.
- Data: `table_images`, `table_music`, `table_music_library`,
  `table_scene_music`, `media_studio_layers`; buckets `table-images` + music
  bucket (see `supabase-persistence.md`).

## Images / video / files / layers
- Media items live on the tldraw canvas (`TableCanvas.tsx`) and are grouped into
  **layers** inside a **scene**. Visibility is scene/layer driven.
- Root layer drop target id is `ROOT_LAYER_DROP_ID` (`__root__`) in
  `lib/table/constants.ts`.
- Use `lib/table/{layer,scene,media}-utils.ts` for placement/visibility logic —
  don't reimplement inline in `GameTable.tsx`.

## Music system
- `MusicSyncEngine.ts` coordinates playback state across the room (realtime).
- Adapters abstract the source: local uploaded audio vs YouTube. Each has its own
  loading, seeking, and error behavior.
- Persistence: current music via `table_music`, per-scene via `table_scene_music`,
  a reusable library via `table_music_library`; audio files in the music bucket.

## Browser & platform limitations
- **Autoplay is blocked** until a user gesture — playback must be gated on
  interaction; do not assume audio starts on load.
- **YouTube** embeds have their own constraints (embeddable flag, region, ads,
  the IFrame API lifecycle) — handle failures gracefully in `youtubeAdapter.ts`.
- Cross-room sync means one client's play/seek propagates; guard against loops
  and stale state.

## Known risks
- Autoplay/gesture handling regressions (silent failures).
- Adapter error paths (a bad URL or non-embeddable video).
- Media/layer/scene references pointing at deleted Supabase rows.
- Sync races between clients.

## Safe edit protocol
1. Read `../workflows/react-table-edit-protocol.md`.
2. Keep source-specific logic inside the adapters; keep placement logic in
   `lib/table/*`.
3. Preserve gesture-gated playback.
4. Verify: open the music panel in `/table`, load local + YouTube, confirm
   play/seek and that scene switching shows the right media/layers.
