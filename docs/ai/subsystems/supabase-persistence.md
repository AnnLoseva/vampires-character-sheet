# Supabase Persistence

## Purpose
Supabase is the shared backend for both layers: it stores characters and all
game-table state (rolls, chat, scenes, media, layers, music) and provides
realtime room sync. Its schema is a **contract** shared by the React table and
the legacy sheet — undocumented drift breaks save/load and sync everywhere.

## Main files
- `lib/supabase.ts` — the React/Next Supabase client.
- `public/supabase.js` — the legacy client + `characters` CRUD (create/update/
  load/list, with `charactersListCache`).
- `modules/table/constants.ts` — centralizes table + bucket names + keys.
- `modules/table/mappers.ts` — maps Supabase rows ↔ app objects.
- `supabase/*.sql` — table definitions, RLS policies, and storage bucket setup.
  `supabase/patch_character_data.sql` defines the character autosave patch RPC.

## Tables and buckets

Storage buckets: `table-images` (constant `TABLE_IMAGE_BUCKET`), a music bucket,
and `character-portraits` (portraits + touchstone images; see
`supabase/character_portraits_storage.sql`). RLS/permissions in
`supabase/{users_characters_rls,media_storage_permissions,character_portraits_storage}.sql`.

**Images are never embedded as base64 in rows.** Portraits/touchstone images go
through `uploadPortraitDataUrl` (`public/supabase.js`) into `character-portraits`;
`characters.data` and `table_chat_messages.character_image` hold public URLs
(base64 only as upload-failure fallback). See the 2026-07-07 DECISIONS entry.

## Character persistence
Handled by the **legacy** `public/supabase.js` against the `characters` table
(the React table also reads `characters` to load player sheets). Saving emits the
`vtm-character-saved` postMessage back to the bridge (see
`character-sheet-bridge.md`). Changing the character row shape affects both
layers.

Legacy autosave patching uses the `vtm_patch_character_data(p_id, p_user_id,
p_patch)` RPC when deployed. The RPC deep-merges object keys atomically in
Postgres and replaces arrays/scalars/nulls whole, matching `mergeCharacterPatch`
in `public/supabase.js`; the browser keeps a select+merge+update fallback while
the SQL is not deployed.

## Table persistence
`GameTable.tsx` reads/writes most `table_*` tables and subscribes to a per-room
realtime channel (`table-room:{room}`). Chat is handled by `modules/chat/*`
against `table_chat_messages`. Names must come from `modules/table/constants.ts`;
row mapping belongs in the relevant module/API.

## Master console persistence

`supabase/master_console_persistence.sql` is the schema/RLS contract;
`modules/master-console/persistence/*` owns constants, types, validation and
mappers. APIs and Realtime hooks are in the adjacent `api/` and `hooks/`
directories. Every subscription is filtered by `room` and cleaned up on effect
teardown. These tables revoke anon access and require Supabase Auth plus a
`chronicle_members` master role. They are deliberately not connected to the
legacy localStorage password gate. Initial chronicle/master provisioning is an
administrator/service-role operation.

Actor persistence is defined separately in `supabase/chronicle_actors.sql` and
depends on the master foundation. A partial unique index prevents linking the
same `characters.id` twice within one chronicle. Linked character data is loaded
from `characters` on hydration and is never copied wholesale into the actor row.
GM-only fields use `chronicle_actor_private`; both actor tables require master
membership. Bulk actor changes use one whitelisted, room-scoped RPC.

Rules chat book search uses `book_pages` and the authenticated-only
`search_book_pages(query, source, limit)` RPC. The authenticated
`librarian-chat` Edge Function gives DeepSeek three controlled read-only tools:
book search through that RPC, owner-only character lookup through
`get_my_characters()`, and active-game search through
`search_library_chronicle(...)`. Every tool call is validated and executed with
the caller's Auth JWT; the model never gets SQL or database credentials. It can
refine short rule-language queries and request several partially named
characters, while the browser keeps device-local journal access. Text is
normalized during ingest; keep PDF page numbers stable so book citations remain
verifiable. Every browser request also carries an allow-listed
`preferredEdition` (`V5`, `V20` or `general`); an explicit edition in the
question overrides that default, and `general` leaves book search unrestricted.
A successful fallback to the other edition is tracked for the request, and the
Edge Function prefixes a clear edition warning if the model omitted one.

Library game history is deliberately separate from master-console membership.
`open_library_chronicle(title)` subscribes the current Auth user only when the
normalized title matches an active library chronicle; it cannot grant a room
role. `list_my_library_chronicles()` drives last-opened preselection, and both
the chunk RLS policy and search RPC require the caller's own
`library_chronicle_members` row. Chronicle source text is private data: ingest
it directly into Supabase, never into the repository.

`/library/chronicles` reads those same chunks directly under RLS and groups them
back into Markdown documents. An authenticated user with an authoritative
`chronicle_members.role = 'master'` may upload Markdown/TXT only into a library
chronicle they have already joined. `replace_library_chronicle_document(...)`
is `SECURITY INVOKER`: its delete/insert stays under dedicated chunk write
policies, validates the JSON/size limits, and atomically replaces rows with the
same `source_name`. This makes the new text immediately available to every
member and to the existing DeepSeek chronicle-search tool without giving the
model or browser any general database capability.

Player uploads use the separate `supabase/personal_chronicles.sql` contract.
The browser stores the entire normalized source as ordered raw chunks before AI
work starts. `personal-chronicle-processor` performs one authenticated DeepSeek
operation per request, writes each cleaned chunk immediately, then creates a
full speaker-labelled transcript plus a shorter player-perspective chronicle
through `complete_personal_chronicle_job(...)`. Interrupted jobs are resumable.
All four personal tables enforce `user_id = auth.uid()`; Chronicle membership
only validates the grouping target and never expands read access. The
Librarian's fixed Chronicle tool combines `search_library_chronicle(...)` with
`search_my_personal_chronicle(...)`, both under the caller's JWT.

## Music / media persistence
Images/media → `table_images` + `table-images` bucket; music → `table_music`,
`table_music_library`, `table_scene_music` + the music bucket; layers →
`media_studio_layers`. See `music-and-media.md`.

## Schema drift risks
- Renaming a table/bucket without updating `constants.ts` + `supabase/*.sql` +
  both clients breaks that feature.
- Changing a row's columns/shape without a migration note breaks save/load.
- Two clients (`lib/supabase.ts`, `public/supabase.js`) can diverge in config.
- RLS changes can silently block anon/authenticated access.

## Safe edit protocol
1. Read `../workflows/supabase-edit-protocol.md`.
2. Never rename tables/buckets casually. Change name in `constants.ts`, both
   clients, mappers, and `supabase/*.sql` together.
3. Never change saved-data shape without a migration note in `DECISIONS.md`.
4. Verify master and player room flow after any change.
